## ML IRIS Dataset


#### Context:

This is a repository containing a popular machine learning dataset called the IRIS dataset. The dataset consists of 150 observations of iris flowers, with 50 observations for each of three different species of iris (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica).

The purpose of this repository is to provide a standardized version of the IRIS dataset that can be easily used for machine learning projects. The dataset is included in both CSV and JSON formats, and is pre-split into training and testing sets. 

#### Data Description
The dataset contains the following columns:

sepal_length: Sepal length in centimeters.

sepal_width: Sepal width in centimeters.

petal_length: Petal length in centimeters.

petal_width: Petal width in centimeters.

species: The species of the iris flower. Possible values are setosa, versicolor, and virginica.
